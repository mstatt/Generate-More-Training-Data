## How to generate synthetic image data
<br />
Some basic tools to extract each frame of a video and save it as an image. The second part is to create as many "VIABLE" versions of each image as possible to augment your image data for computer vision model training.

> Synthetic data is information that's artificially generated rather than produced by real-world events. Typically created using algorithms, synthetic data can be deployed to validate mathematical models and to train machine learning models. Data generated by a computer simulation can be seen as synthetic data.
    <br />

> Synthetic data is artificially annotated information that is generated by computer algorithms or simulations. Often, synthetic data is used as a substitute when suitable real-world data is not available â€“ for instance, to augment a limited machine learning dataset with additional examples

<!-- How to use -->
## Usage
<br />
  <p>
   To use the scripts for maximum value please foloow the steps below:
    <br />
</p>

1. Place the video file in the video directory. <br />(You can place numerous videos in the directory for sequential processing).<br />
Understand that the images will be generated in a Directory names after the video file.<br /> Example: my_video.mp4 -> images/my_video/ 
```
python split_videos_in_dir__into_images_and_rename.py
```
2. Move all of the images created from their folders and place them in the "OriginalImages" directory.
```
create-grey-and-rotate-images.py
```
3. This will give you 1 X 16 count. For every 1 original image, 15 will be generated.
