## How to generate synthetic image data
<br />
Some basic scripts to extract each frame of a video and save it as an image. The second part is to create as many "VIABLE" versions of each image as possible to augment your image data for computer vision model training.
    <br /><br /><br />

> Synthetic data is information that's artificially generated rather than produced by real-world events. Typically created using algorithms, synthetic data can be deployed to validate mathematical models and to train machine learning models. Data generated by a computer simulation can be seen as synthetic data.
    <br />

> Synthetic data is artificially annotated information that is generated by computer algorithms or simulations. Often, synthetic data is used as a substitute when suitable real-world data is not available â€“ for instance, to augment a limited machine learning dataset with additional examples

<!-- How to use -->
## Usage
<br />
  <p>
   To use the scripts for maximum value please follow the steps below:
    <br />
</p>

1. Place the video file in the video directory. <br />(You can place numerous videos in the directory for sequential processing).<br />
Understand that the images will be generated in a Directory named after the video file.<br /> Example: my_video.mp4 -> images/my_video/ 
```
python split_videos_in_dir__into_images_and_rename.py
```
2. Move all of the images created from their folders and place them in the "OriginalImages" directory.
```
python create-grey-and-rotate-images.py
```
3. This will give you 1 X 16 count. For every 1 original image, 15 will be generated.
4. However, This does not always have to be the process. 
5. If you already have images you would like to expand, just drop them in the "OriginalImages" directory and run the following:
```
python create-grey-and-rotate-images.py
```
6. Similarly, if you just want to chop a video into each of its frames and dont want to generate extras versions of each frame just place your video file in the "video" directory and run the following:
```
python split_videos_in_dir__into_images_and_rename.py
```

<!-- Enhancements -->
## Enhancements
<p>
Below are some basic enhancements that could be done to make this better.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Automation of the listing and moving of each of the images created from the video into the "OriginalImages" directory.</li>
<li>Combine both scripts into a single fully functional version.</li>
<li>And whatever else you can think of.</li>

</ol>
